# Introduction to phylogenetics using R, using influenza virus sequences

This project is a practical introduction to phylogenetics using R. The project structure consists of:

- `phylo-practical.Rnw`: the *knitr* document of the practical
- `phylo-practical.pdf`: the pdf version of the practical; to recompile it freshly, use: `knitr::knit2pdf("phylo-practical.Rnw")`
- `data/`: a folder containing two datasets:
  - `usflu.annot.csv`: annotations of the sequences
  - `usflu.fasta`: a *fasta* file containing aligned sequences
- `figs/`: figures produced by *knitr* as well as images used to generate the pdf
